# Responsive-Navigation
Responsive Navigation using React Hooks | Grid, and Flex-Box

One of the first things I taught myself was how to build a responsive navigation.  There are a multitude of libraries and plug-ins available to do this, but what happens when an employer or a client wants the navigation to do this or that and your plug-in isnâ€™t very accommodating.?  The goal of this tutorial to give you a basic understanding of how to accommodate these circumstances from scratch.  
Side Note: This is my first attempt at writing a tutorial.  All criticism is welcome ðŸ˜Š
